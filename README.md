HTMX Demo Plain Vanilla Javascript Frontend

My forte' as a developer is working with Java, Spring Boot, Microservices, and creating RESTful API's and then pushing them into a Docker Container and/or Kubernetes.
Therefore, I have an existing back-end server which is serving all of the following:
1. There is a full complement of RESTful API endpoints that will produce JSON.
2. There is a full complement of GraphQL API endpoints that will produce GraphQL JSON.
3. There is a full complement of HTMX endpoints that will return HTML chunks.

In my desire to become a Full-Stack Developer, I am learning React first.
I know it has been many years since I developed HTML, CSS, and Javascript (2008).
Since then, I have been mostly on teams exclusively working on the back-end, and the Spring Boot framework, Java, and Microservices tool certainly has been a lot to learn and stay up to date with.

It was suggested that before I get into React again, that I refresh myself with the basics, and I have to say I agree.
So, this web-page is using pure HTML, CSS, and Javascript in order to develop a CRUD based application for a simple PhoneBook App.
This web-site will be using the RESTful API from the HTMX Demo application which will be running locally in a Docker Container, but could easily be pushed out to ECS/Fargate.
